        <h2>About Oliver</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Age: 7 years old</li>
            <li>Breed: Labrador & Pyr mix</li>
            <li>Neutered: Yes</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="food content">
        <h2>Food and Water</h2>
        <p>Oliver is used to eating at 5pm. Sometimes he forgets to drink water. He may need to be reminded.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="treats content">
        <h2>Treats</h2>
        <p>Oliver is food motivated! Treats are a great way to let him know he’s doing well. They can also be
            helpful
            when he’s feeling a bit anxious.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alone content">
        <h2>Home Alone</h2>
        <p>Oliver can get scared when left alone. His safe space is his bed. Before I leave the house I ask him to
            sit
            in his bed and lay down. I talk to him and tell him he is going to stay. He understands this. A treat
            always
            helps calm his nerves.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="walks content">
        <h2>Walks and Exercise</h2>
        <p>Oliver is happiest when he gets at least 2 walks a day. At home he walks every day without a leash on a
            wooded trail. He should be leashed near a road or walking through a neighborhood (so many smells!)
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="bedtime content">
        <h2>Bedtime</h2>
        <p>Oliver prefers to sleep near someone at night, but with a little encouragement he will be OK sleeping on his
            own in another room.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="interactions content">
        <h2>Interactions</h2>
        <p>Oliver is a friendly and curious boy who is always excited to meet and smell new people.</p>
